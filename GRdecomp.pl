# GRdecomp.pl derived from Rdecomp.pl
#
#Dec. 31 modify with swtarget and tswtarget, so that GRdecomp is expected to be called from SWhybpipe.pl. Need to
#rewrite this to be more general so that GRdecomp can be run stand-alone.
#
# Dec. 28, 2020
# Modify Rdecomp.pl, which was specialized to handle the grass data, for any data.
#
# Call as perl GRdecomp.pl matrix_file_name 
#
# The matrix name is prefixX.Ymstmatrix, 
# when the dataset has been generated
# randomly from ms, for example.
# for example t3.12mstmatrix  
#
#
# Rdecomp.pl derived from clean_for_hybridtrees.pl
# Dec. 3, 2020
# DG This program calls clean_for_hybridtrees recursively to do the full cluster decomposition of the input matrix. The output is in file "decomponly" where each
# leaf of the recursion tree has the string written below it, along with the KWARG upper bound (for the cluster problem, not the hybridization problem)
# for that matrix. Then to find the hybridization number of the original input matrix, we find the hybridization number
# of each of these subproblems, and sum their hybridization numbers. The output file ``decomp" also has these matrices, but has much more information
# that can be used to check correctness.
#
# Currently, Dec. 11, 2020, this program is taylored to examine the grass data. Each grass datafile has the name "grassx.ymatrix", where
# x is the number of trees in the input, and y is the largest leaf index. In the grass data, the leaves
# are numbered starting from 0, so y is one less than the number of leaves (in each tree). The program is gerry-rigged so that the file "outx.y" is written to and then read, and then
# written to. This needs to be cleaned up someday, but it works for now.
#
# Call Rdecomp.pl as: perl Rdecomp.pl grassx.ymatrix > outx.y
#
# The stand-alone program clean_for_hybridtrees.pl has been incorporated as a subroutine, and information about the stand-alone program is given below.
#
#
# DG Nov. 20, modified clean_for_hybridtrees so that duplicate columns inside the same tree are removed. Such duplicate cols. will never be part of the input, since
# each column corresponds to a split, and each split in a tree is recorded exactly once, but after the other part of cleanup (removing some rows and cols),
# duplicate cols. can be created. Note that, unlike the case for building a DAG for representing clusters (in a cluster-network), we must not
# remove duplicate cols. that come from different trees, because that split must be part of each tree specification.
#
#
# DG This program should clean a binary matrix as used in computing the hybridization number in the version when a given set of
# trees must be represented in the resulting DAG. 
#
# The input is the output of parse_Newick.pl where the FIRST TWO lines produced
# by parse_Newick.pl (the borders line and the tree_string line) are NOT removed. The output has a line with
# only the new borders between the columns representing the input trees, followed by the cleaned matrix.
# 
# July 29, 2020 Currently the program assumes that the number of trees is at most nine.
#
# the input matrix should have no spaces between the bits in the binary matrix.
#
# call on a terminal command line as: perl clean_for_hybridtrees.pl input-file-name
#
# derived from cleanup.pl
# July 28, 2020
#

# July 30, 2020 These programs do not use or alter border information. They just pass borders, as cborders or tborders or newcborders back and forth
# to make sure that passing is working correctly, in case we do want to use borders later. If we never do need it, we will delete it then.
